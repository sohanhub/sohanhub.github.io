        <p class="lead">The hot and dry desert – Sahara
          The Sahara is known as the world’s largest desert, covering over 8.54 million square kilometres. It is the
          largest, and the hottest desert in the world.

          Sahara desert is located in tropical regions, which are 1,000 m above sea level. It covers a huge part of
          North Africa, and eleven other countries – Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Mali, Chad, Niger, Western Sahara, Sudan,
          Mauritania, Libya and Morocco.

          The total area actually measures about 8,600,000 square kilometres, which is 4,800 km approximately from east
          to west, and between 800 and 1,200 km from north to south.

          The climate in this region is extremely hot, sizzling, and dry, and often receives small quantities of
          precipitation throughout the year.

          In this hot desert, the days are scorching. During the day, temperatures will rise as high as 45° C to 50° C,
          heating the bare rocks and the sand. The nights can be extremely cold, with temperatures going below 0° C,
          sometimes.

          The cold and dry desert of Ladakh
          Ladakh is famously known as the cold desert of India. It is found in the high altitudes of the temperate
          regions, which lie in the Great Himalayas within the eastern parts of Jammu and Kashmir and located in the
          western Himalayas region, within Himachal Pradesh in North India.

          The altitude in Ladakh ranges from about 3,000 m in Kargil to 8,000 m in Karakoram. Due to its high altitude,
          the climate remains extremely cold and dry. The day temperatures in summer are just above 0° C and the night
          temperatures go below –30° C.

          The Gangotri glacier along with several other glaciers are found here, along with different rivers flowing
          through Ladakh. Among the rivers, Indus is the most important river that flows through Ladakh.

          In Ladakh, there are very few, tiny patches of grasses and shrubs for animals to graze on. Many poplars,
          groves of willows and shrubs of the genus Salix are seen in the valleys.

        <p class="lead">A community of living organisms of a particular region living in conjunction with non-living
          components is called an ecosystem. An ecosystem can be as small as an oasis in a desert, or as big as an
          ocean.

          What is a Terrestrial Ecosystem?
          The type of ecosystems which are predominantly found on land are called the terrestrial ecosystems.
          Terrestrial ecosystems cover approximately 140 to 150 million km2, which is about 25 to 30 percent of the
          total earth surface area.

          Types Of Terrestrial Ecosystems
          There are different types of terrestrial ecosystems, which are widely distributed around the geological zones.
          They include:

          Forest

          These types of ecosystems include both temperate deciduous forest, plantation forests and tropical rain
          forests. They serve as a natural habitat for a vast range of living species and also comprise the highest
          species diversity. Forests cover nearly 30 to 35 million square kilometres of the earth’s surface and more
          than 300 million species of plants and animals live in forests.

          Grasslands

          Grasslands are the most dominant type of vegetation and these types of environments occur naturally in several
          parts of the world. These types of terrestrial ecosystems serve as a home for a wide diversity of animal
          species, such as elephants, giraffes, hyenas, jackrabbits, lions, rhinos, warthogs and zebras. Other types of

        <p class="lead"> Marine Aquatic Ecosystem
          Marine ecosystem covers the largest surface area of the earth. Two third of earth is covered by water and they
          constitute of oceans, seas, intertidal zone, reefs, seabed, estuaries, hydrothermal vents and rock pools. Each
          life form is unique and native to its habitat. This is because they have adaptations according to their
          habitat. In the case of aquatic animals, they can’t survive outside of water. Exceptional cases are still
          there which shows another example of adaptations (e.g. mudskippers). The marine ecosystem is more concentrated
          with salts which make it difficult for freshwater organisms to live in. Also, marine animals cannot survive in
          freshwater. Their body is adapted to live in saltwater; if they are placed in less salty water, their body
          will swell (osmosis).

          Ocean Ecosystems
          Our planet earth is gifted with the five major oceans, namely Pacific, Indian, Arctic, and the Atlantic Ocean.
          Among all these five oceans, the Pacific and the Atlantic are the largest and deepest ocean. These oceans
          serve as a home to more than five lakh aquatic species. Few creatures of these ecosystems include shellfish,
          shark, tube worms, crab small and large ocean fishes, turtles, crustaceans, blue whale, reptiles, marine
          mammals, seabirds, plankton, corals and other ocean plants.
